# Chat
An uncreatively named chat website that I wrote when I was starting out with javascript

***DO NOT USE IT FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN STUDYING THE CODE*** It is insecure, it will not be updated and depends on a lot of vulnerable packages.

## Applications and libraries
This application uses Node.js with Express.js to run the server. The database is a PostrgeSQL instance. 

## Skills that I obtained from this project
- Basic server structure, POST and GET requests to implement CRUD
- Structuring SQL schemas and querying and updating data in them
- XSS and CSRF
- WebSockets
